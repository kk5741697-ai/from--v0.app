ðŸ”¹ Tools Layout Structure (Consistent Across All Tools)
Upload View (when files.length === 0):

Unified before canvas ads
Upload area
Unified After canvas ads
Rich educational content
Footer
Tool Interface (when files.length > 0):

Tools header
Unified before canvas ads
Canvas/workspace area
Unified after canvas ads
Sidebar (desktop - right side fixed) / Mobile panel
No footer

ðŸ”¹ Canvas preview behavior 
pdf tools -> selected file are show as list, which tools need page preview - they will be thumbnail page preview. based on the tools specification the pages will be drag to reorder, select, etc. improve overall things for tools specified behavior.
image tools -> crop tools or which are single file mode, they should be show full preview, not as thumbnail. no need `original` and `processed`, this are very bad. you need handle this more smartly. which tools support bulk/multiple files, they should be thumbnails - not full page preview. and many features specified tools.

ðŸ”¹ AdSense Compliance
Only 2 ad slots: unified-before-canvas and unified-after-canvas
Persistent ads: Same ads reused, no additional requests
Rich content: Educational guides for each tool type

note: when tools interface are active, then the upload zone, rich content, footer will be hidden.

always use layout file for each tools type
@/components/tools-layouts/image-tools-layout.tsx
@/components/tools-layouts/qrcode-tools-layout.tsx
@/components/tools-layouts/pdf-tools-layout.tsx
@/components/tools-layouts/text-tools-layout.tsx
@/components/tools-layouts/network-tools-layout.tsx
@/components/tools-layouts/seo-tools-layout.tsx
@/components/tools-layouts/utilities-tools-layout.tsx

never generate the fake thumbnail + image-generation with pdf.js rendering, generate the real thumbnail + image-generation with pdf.js rendering.


also don't remove the .env file
